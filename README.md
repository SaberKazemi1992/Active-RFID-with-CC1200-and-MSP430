# Active-RFID-with-CC1200-and-Arduino Mega2560
In this project, measurements of 5 sensors are put in the payload of an active RFID system connected to MSP430. In this system, the user has full control of register configurations. The register configuration is facilitated by SmartRF Studio. 


The user can change the carrier frequency, packet length, etc. Multiple scenarios can be implemented with this system. The physical layer is CC1200. For example, a majority of wireless communications need two-sided communication. This system enables the bidirectional communication.
