# Active-RFID-with-CC1200-and-Mega2560
In this project, measurements of 5 sensors are put in the payload of an active RFID system connected to Mega2560. In this system, the user has full control of register configurations. The register configuration is facilitated by SmartRF Studio. 


The user can change the carrier frequency, packet length, etc. Multiple scenarios can be implemented with this system. The physical layer is CC1200. A majority of wireless sensor modules need two-sided communication and this system enables the bidirectional communication.

#CC1200
The CC1200 device is a fully integrated single-chip radio transceiver designed for high performance at
very low-power and low-voltage operation in cost-effective wireless systems. All filters are integrated, thus
removing the need for costly external SAW and IF filters. The device is mainly intended for the ISM
(Industrial, Scientific, and Medical) and SRD (Short Range Device) frequency bands at 164–190 MHz,
410–475 MHz, and 820–950 MHz.
The CC1200 device provides extensive hardware support for packet handling, data buffering, burst
transmissions, clear channel assessment, link quality indication, and Wake-On-Radio. The main operating
parameters of the CC1200 device can be controlled through an SPI interface. In a typical system, the
CC1200 device will be used with a microcontroller and only a few external passive components.
